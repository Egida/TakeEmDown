# Knock Em 1.5
 
v5:
 
Fixed get method, and minor changes. 
 
V4:
 
New methods, and made everything look nicer.

v3:
 
Added ICMP, DNS, MEMCACHED, and NTP. Also removed TCP abuse till I find out how to fix it.
 
v2:

Don't know how to explain this but use "sudo python3 DDoS.py -h" for new info on how to use

v1:
 
Has basic methods, like TCP, UDP, and GET.

Has less known methods, like NGINX bypass, CLOUDFARE bypass, and TCP ABUSE.

TCP abuse is not working at the moment, will be updated!

NGINX uses the slowloris method (keep alive) and also spoofs user agents.

CLOUDFARE uses cloudscraper, this has stopped https://florida.gop/ before.

TCP abuse uses tcp message, it used to work on other codes, but now those codes aren't working, I will look into it!

UDP is really fast.

TCP (syn) isn't that fast.

Lastly, GET, is the fastest method, the CLOUDFARE bypass is more powerfull sometimes. BUT the GET method can be stopped (by the website) really fast.
