# TakeEmDown

Has basic methods, like TCP, UDP, and GET.

Has less known methods, like NGINX bypass, CLOUDFARE bypass, and TCP ABUSE.

TCP abuse is not working at the moment, will be updated!

NGINX uses the slowloris method (keep alive) and also spoofs user agents.

CLOUDFARE uses cloudscraper, this has stopped https://florida.gop/ before.

TCP abuse uses tcp message, it used to work on other codes, but now those codes aren't working, I will look into it!

UDP is really fast.

TCP (syn) isn't that fast.

Lastly, GET, is the fastest method, the CLOUDFARE bypass is more powerfull sometimes. BUT the GET method can be stopped (by the website) really fast.
